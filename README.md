# Visualization-of-A-star-Pathfinding-Algo
**AIM:** To design an application, with an effectively efficient mechanism which takes the start and end points on a two-dimensional grid having black blocks represent the obstacles that has to be overcomed inorder to obtain the shortest possible path from start point to the end point on the grid.

## Software Required
Preferred environment: VS code along with python and its extension

To `install` python, click [here](https://www.python.org/)

To `install` and `set up` VS code for python programing environment, click [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/python) 

## How to run?
STEP 1. [Download](https://github.com/AnkitaTandon/Visualization-of-A-star-Pathfinding-Algo) the src file.

STEP 2. Run this command on the terminal to install pygame module `pip install pygame` 

STEP 3. Now, run the code file on the terminal using the command `python astar.py`
        
STEP 4. A plan white 700X700 grid appears. Choose your start point (orange) followed by the end point (turquoise) anywhere on the grid and then select the blocks to build the barrier (black). 
Use left click to select and right click to unselect.

STEP 5. Hit the _spacebar_ to run the algorithm to obtain the best possible optimal path.  
        
STEP 6. Click `OK` when the message dialogue box appears and enter the button _C_ to clear the screen and repeat from STEP 4 again or `QUIT`.
